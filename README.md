# Project overview

Welcome to my React Shopping Cart project, the culmination of my journey through the React section of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart)!

The aim here was to create an engaging mock shopping website where users can explore a variety of products and add them to their cart.

Products displayed on the website were sourced from the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/).

# What I learned

- Handling routing and API requests within React

This project also served as an opportunity to experiment with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. :smile:

# What's next

I plan to expand upon this foundation by incorporating features such as user authentication, more advanced cart functionality, and a refined user interface.
